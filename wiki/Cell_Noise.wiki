= Algorithm = 
Cell Noise is a very simple algorithm, but can yield incredible results. The algorithm only has two parts:

  # Set up an array of points around the image
  # For any pixel, the value is the distance from the n^th^ closest point.

This is relatively simple, but the simplicity allows for a lot of experimentation. A few things can be mixed up.

  * The distance function
  * Which point to use for the distance function
  * How to combine the above two
